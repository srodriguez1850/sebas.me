  							With advances in machine learning, autonomous agents are increasingly able to navigate uncertain operational environments, as is the case within the multi-domain operations (MDO) paradigm. When teaming with humans, autonomous agents may flexibly switch between passive bystander and active executor depending on the task requirements and the actions being taken by partners (whether human or agent). In many tasks, it is possible that a well-trained agent’s performance will exceed that of a human, in part because the agent’s performance is less likely to degrade over time (e.g., due to fatigue). This potential difference in performance might lead to automation complacency, which is a state defined by over-trust in automated systems. This paper investigates the effects of automation complacency in human-agent teams, where agents and humans have the same capabilities in a simulated version of the predator-prey pursuit task. We compare qualitative measures of the human's predisposition to complacency and trust using the Automation-induced Complacency Potential scale, and validate their beliefs by quantifying complacency through various metrics associated with the actions taken during the task with expertly trained agents. By evaluating the effect of complacency on performance, we can attribute a degree of variation in human performance in this task to automation complacency. We can then account for an individual human’s complacency measure to customize their agent teammates and human-in-the-loop requirements (either to minimize or compensate for the human’s complacency) to optimize team performance.

  							<h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Knowledge Complacency in Decision Support Systems</h5>
  							Decision support systems (DSS), which are often based on complex statistical, machine learning, and AI models, have increasingly become a core part of data analytics and sensemaking processes.  Automation complacency -- a state characterized by over-trust in intelligent systems -- has the potential to result in catastrophic performance failure.  An under-investigated factor in automation complacency research is the effect that DSS might have on human learning of domain concepts. In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of two studies of users interacting with decision aids to understand how knowledge retention is affected by the competence and presentation of a DSS.  Our results indicate that while humans have the opportunity to learn and internalize domain concepts while being supported by a DSS, features that make the DSS appear more competent, persuasive, or customizable may lead a user to form incorrect beliefs about a domain.

  							<h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Participatory Simulations for CS Education with a Hackable Electronic Conference Badge</h5>
  							Computer science (CS) is becoming an increasingly diverse domain. This paper reports on an initiative designed to introduce underrepresented populations to computing using an eclectic, multifaceted approach. As part of a yearlong computing course, students engage in Maker activities, participatory simulations, and computing projects that foreground the social and collaborative aspects of CS. Collectively, these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS. A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided--Wearing the Web--in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data from the first year of the CT4G program are presented to show the positive effects that this diverse introduction to CS is having on the students with respect to their attitudes toward CS.
